<summary><b>Task 1:</b> Task is to refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler</summary>

### C Language based LAB
We have to follow the given steps to compile any **.c** file in our machine:  
1. Open the terminal and locate to the directory where you want to create your file. Then run the following command:

	```
	gedit sum_1ton.c
	```  
2. This will open the text editor and allows you to write the code. You have to write the C code of printing the sum of n numbers. Once you are done with your code, press ```Ctrl + S``` to save your file, and then press ```Ctrl + W``` to close the editor.   
3. To the C code on your terminal, run the following command:

	```
	gcc sum_1ton.c
	./a.out
	```
